Who? What? Why?
---------------

This app was written by Dave Peck (http://davepeck.org/) and Brian Dorsey (http://dorseys.org/).

We wrote it for fun, and because we felt that just about every other similar app out there wasn't very good.

It's (obviously) open source! We don't know what license yet, but we'll probably use the BSD license unless we have a specific reason not to.

We currently have one mobile front-end: the iPhone. We hope people will contribute Android, Pre, etc. front-ends soon.

The back-end is python + App Engine, currently using WebApp (but we'll probably move to Django 1.1 soon.)


Current State Of The Code
-------------------------

As of Wednesday, Dec. 16, 2009, this repro contains a functional iPhone app and a minimal but functional server back-end. Try it out!
