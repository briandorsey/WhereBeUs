add cron to expire updates over 2 hours old
add update_age (in seconds) calculated from update_datetime


Brian -- I made some changes to the service format. All replies have 'success' and 'message' fields 
in addition to everything else, just to make handling errors (like datastore under high load) a little
easier.

I realized that the hashtag/foo/ call wasn't actually producing filled dictionaries so I changed
it. I wasn't sure how you wanted to use the sharedutils stuff so I cut it out... put it back 
in as desired...
