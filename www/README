update dictionary
-----------------

This is passed up by the client when their location changes and returned by the
server.

{
    "twitter_user_name": "name",
    "twitter_full_name": "full name",
    "twitter_profile_image_url": "http://someurl",
    "hashtag": "hashtag",
    "latitude": 123.456,
    "longitude": 123.456
}

Message is not needed because it is only shared with twitter.

Update time doesn't need to be sent from the phone -- let our service decide.


/api/1/hashtag/THETAG/
-------------------

GET - returns a list of update dictionaries which match THETAG.


/api/1/update/
--------------

POST - a single update dictionary with (presumably) updated location info. The
twitter_user_name is used as the DataStore key_name. Any previous data for that
user is overwritten.
